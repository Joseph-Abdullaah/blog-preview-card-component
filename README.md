# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

This is my solution to the [Blog preview card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/blog-preview-card-ckPaj01IcS). This challenge helped me practice working with layout, responsiveness, and styling a small component with clean design.

## My process

### Built with

* CSS custom properties (variables)
* Flexbox
* Media queries for responsive design

### What I learned

I improved my ability to:

* Apply **custom CSS properties** to make colors reusable and the code easier to manage.
* Make the layout responsive using **flexbox** and **media queries**.

Here’s a simple snippet I’m proud of:

```css
.mainContainer {
  max-width: 38.6rem;
  background-color: var(--White);
  border-radius: 2rem;
  box-shadow: 10px 10px var(--Grey950);
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

* Improve my responsive design techniques for smaller screens
* Create a more organized system for **class naming** in HTML
* Build more components with real-world layout challenges

### Useful resources

* [MDN Web Docs - Flexbox Guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flexbox) - Helped me with layout alignment.
* [CSS Variables Tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/a-complete-guide-to-custom-properties/) - Helped me understand how to use CSS custom properties effectively.
